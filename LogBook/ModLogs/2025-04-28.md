# Array & List in Java

- _Array_ - a very basic data structure. It has a fixed, predetermined size that must be known at the time of creating (instantiating) the array. Think of it as a _sorting box_ with several slots. Here, you have `.length` - without parentheses as it is a _property_, not a method
    
- _List_ - an _interface_ (not a _class_) that defines certain behavior. It cannot be instantiated on its own.
    
- _ArrayList_ - a concrete _class_ that implements the _List_ interface.
