# Recipe Manager :

The full collection of recipes needs to be a json dictionnary, with keys the recipe resource id and of value dictionaries, each having keys `input`, `output`, `type`, holding respectively the values : dictionaries of keys the item resource ids and of value the amount, same for output, and a string

The full object is as follows :

```
[
"mod:recipe1" : [
	"type" : "mod:type",
	"input" : [
		"mod:item1" : 1,
		"mod:item2" : 3,
		...
		],
	"output" : [
		"mod:item3" : 1,
		...
		]
	],
...
]
```

# Ingredients 

`Ingredient.getItems()` returns a list of all valid items for an ingredient, i.e. for the sticks recipe, every wood type is contained in this ingredient
This means that we need to iterate on this list, add every entry and their amount

However, we need to be careful here when we'll propagate the SCT values. If we naively propagate the value of n values which correspond to the same ingredient, we'll overestimate the total SCT value of the crafted item. We thus need to treat an ingredient as a single node when propagating the values (which value to chose from all items within the node, that I do not know). To translate this in the JSON, we replace the `"input" : {"key1" : int, ...}` with `"input" : {"key1" : ["item1" : int, ...], ...}`

Thus 
```
[
"mod:recipe1" : [
	"type" : "mod:type",
	"input" : [
		"ingredient1" : [
			"item1" : 1,
			"item2" : 1
			...
			],
		"ingredient2" : [
			"item3" : 2
			...
			],
		...
		],
	"output" : [
		"mod:item3" : 1,
		...
		]
	],
...
]
```

Sometimes (mainly shaped recipes), when a single ingredient is used multiple times, instead of being defined as a single `Ingredient` object with `n` item count, it will be defined as `n` times the same `Ingredient` object, with the same address in memory.
=> We need to combine those objects into 1
